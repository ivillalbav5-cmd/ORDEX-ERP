description: Skip automatic browser verification unless explicitly requested

# Verification Rules

1. **Do NOT** automatically run browser verification after completing code changes.
2. Only perform browser verification (screenshots, recordings, visual checks) when the user explicitly asks for it.
3. After completing code changes, simply summarize what was done and notify the user.
4. Trust that the dev server hot-reloads and the user can verify visually on their own.
